        <h5>The Sustainable Development Goals of Perechin Timber and Chemical Plant</h5>
        <div class="text-center my-3"><img class="w-50" src="../static/img/news/en_1.jpg" alt="goals-picture"/></div>
        <p>What's best for everyone is our customer-centric strategy, which will enable us to secure a more stable and sustainable future. It is focused on innovation of products and processes with the help of investments and support of relations with customers and partners.</p>
        <p>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the Global Goals, are an overarching call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure peace and prosperity for all people around the world.</p>
        <p>These 17 Goals are a development of the success of the Millennium Development Goals; moreover, among other priorities, they also cover new areas such as climate change, economic inequality, innovation, sustainable consumption, peace and justice. The goals are interrelated - the key to success in one of them is solving issues that are generally related to the others.</p>
        <p>On September 25, 2015, the UN General Assembly adopted the Post - 2015 Development Agenda: "Transforming our world: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development."</p>
        <p>Whereas the world tries to unite around these goals, the SDGs are attracting significant interest and support from businesses around the world. We recognize their importance and support the goals of sustainable development through our corporate mission and contribute to their achievement through our broad activities. In total, there are 17 SDGs and 169 tasks. While they are all important and interrelated, some will be more relevant to our business than others. We've highlighted the specific SDGs and challenges our company prioritizes and will demonstrate how they align with our business strategy and goals.</p>
        <div class="text-center my-3"><img class="w-50" src="../static/img/news/en_2.jpg" alt="goals-picture"/></div>

        <p><b>Priority SDG 3: Affordable and clean energy.</b><span> 100% transition to renewable energy sources by 2030. Transition from natural gas to renewable energy sources when the pyrolysis process starts by 2026. By 2026, convert excess energy from the pyrolysis process into electricity using a steam turbine generator. Constantly monitor the energy efficiency of production processes. Invest in clean energy technology research.</span></p>
        <p><b>Priority SDG 4: Decent work and economic growth.</b><span> To conduct continuous training of employees according to their work specialty. Constantly ensure that employees receive equal pay for equal work in accordance with legal norms and market standards. Increase the number of employees with disabilities by 7% by 2025.

To support the development of domestic technologies, research and innovations in Ukraine.</span></p>
        <p><b>Priority SDG 6: Responsible consumption and production.</b><span> By 2030, achieve sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources, significantly reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse. By 2026, achieve environmentally sound management of chemicals and all waste throughout their life cycle in accordance with agreed international frameworks and significantly reduce their emissions to air, water and soil to minimize their negative impact on human health and the environment.</span></p>
        <p><b>Priority SDG 7: Climate action.</b><span> Transition from natural gas to renewable energy sources when the pyrolysis process starts by 2026, convert excess energy from the pyrolysis process into electricity using a steam turbine generator. By 2030, carry out internal logistics transportation on green fuel. Constantly monitor the energy efficiency of production processes.</span></p>
        <p><b>Priority SDG 8: Life on land.</b><span> Continue to be positive about forests by promoting sustainable forest management to eliminate forest degradation and deforestation. Use of innovative approaches to forest management, protection, recovery and restoration. Continue to source wood and other raw materials from more sustainable sources. Inviting and empowering customers and other partners to be part of the solution by making it easy to purchase products.</span></p>
        <p><b>Priority SDG 9: Peace, justice and strong institutions.</b><span> Significantly reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms. Ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms in accordance with national legislation and international agreements.</span></p>
        <p><b>Priority SDG 10: Partnerships for the goals.</b><span> Approach to tax. Tax jurisdictions and main activities. Support of small suppliers. Case study: revealing opportunities for creating climate-adapted forestry. Integrating water resources management into our business. Conducting biodiversity status reports and action plans for our forestry operations. Collaboration across the value chain. Working together on changes. Stakeholder engagement: partners and industry associations.</span></p>
        <p>The UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a framework for collective action to address global challenges such as poverty, gender equality and climate change. We recognize that we have an important role to play in contributing to the achievement of the SDGs by leveraging the global influence of the Perechin Timber and Chemical Plant and the value chain. We have used the Development Goals as one of the key inputs when developing our 2030 strategy and ambitions. Due to the interconnectedness of the SDG, most of the activities of the Perechin Timber and Chemical Plant contribute to the achievement of more than one of them.</p>
        <p>The evaluation process and results provided information that will help inform how we should focus our efforts and resources. In some areas, we will strengthen the approach outlined in the Priority Development Goals, such as our focus on sustainable forests, human rights and labor relations. Other areas that offer us opportunities to demonstrate bold action and leadership include our new Net-Zero commitment, nature and biodiversity, diversity, inclusion and equity, and circularity.</p>
