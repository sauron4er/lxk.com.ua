    p We‚Äôre proud to share that Nataliya Korol, representative of LLC Perechin Timber and Chemical Plant, delivered a report titled:
    p ‚ÄúOptimizing Binder Selection for Durable and Waterproof Charcoal Briquettes: Balancing Mechanical Strength and Water Resistance‚Äù
    p This contribution highlights our ongoing commitment to innovation in sustainable materials ‚Äî perfectly aligned with the QUEEN Project's mission to develop an environmentally friendly process for producing metallurgical grade silicon (MG-Si) from quarry sands, reducing total CO‚ÇÇ emissions.
    p With 14 partners from across Europe, the QUEEN Project aims to transform EU quarries into potential MG-Si reservoirs through advanced, adaptable technologies. üöÄ
    p Stay tuned for more updates as we continue moving toward a cleaner, greener future!
